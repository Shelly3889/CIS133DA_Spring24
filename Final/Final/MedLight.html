                            Fiddle-leaf figs instantly give any room a jungle-like vibe. 
                            They grow very slowly, but can eventually reach the ceiling. 
                            With a reputation for being finicky, this cold-sensitive rainforest native needs just the right conditions to thrive indoors. 
                            Prefers east-facing, sunny windows; unobstructed late day sun in a west- or south-facing window may burn the leaves.

                            Also called rattlesnake plant, peacock plant, or zebra plant, this popular houseplant is grown for its decorative foliage in an assortment of patterns, colors, and shapes.
                            Prayer plants don't like their roots disturbed, so repot in early spring only if rootbound.

                            <b>Water:</b> ZZ plants store water in their semi-succulent stems so you may only need to water every couple weeks. 
                            Overwatering can do more damage than underwatering, so don't allow the soil to become soggy. <br>
                            <b>Fertilize:</b> They are light feeders, so only fertilize every three months or so. <br>

                            The naturally shiny leaves of the ZZ plant require little effort to maintain their good looks. 
                            Simply dust them off with a damp cloth (leaf sprays may damage the foliage). ZZ plants also do well in medium/bright, indirect light. 
                            Keep in mind that all parts of the plant are toxic, so keep away from children and pets.

                            Cast iron plants are extremely slow growing and can take years to reach their full height. 
                            Cast iron plants are almost impervious to neglect and aptly named for their tough-as-nails constitution.
