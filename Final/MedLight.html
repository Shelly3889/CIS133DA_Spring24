                            <b>Water:</b> From spring to fall, water when the top inch of soil feels dry, more sparingly in winter. <br>
                            <b>Fertilize:</b> Apply a high-nitrogen fertilizer that includes micronutrients monthly from spring through fall. Don't feed during winter months. <br>
                            
                            Fiddle-leaf figs instantly give any room a jungle-like vibe. 
                            They grow very slowly, but can eventually reach the ceiling. 
                            With a reputation for being finicky, this cold-sensitive rainforest native needs just the right conditions to thrive indoors. 
                            Prefers east-facing, sunny windows; 
                            unobstructed late day sun in a west- or south-facing window may burn the leaves.

                            <b>Fertilize:</b> Fertilize every two weeks when actively growing from spring through fall; monthly in winter.<br>

                            Rubber plants can threaten to outgrow a room, but can be kept in check by pruning off the top at the central stem. 
                            This will encourage growth of side branches. 
                            Keeping your plant in a smaller pot will also curb its growth.

                            <b>Water:</b> Tradescantias prefer moist soil, but avoid overwatering to prevent root rot. <br>
                            <b>Fertilize:</b>Use a balanced liquid houseplant fertilizer monthly. <br>

                            An easy-to-grow, trailing plant that is great for beginners. 
                            Perfect for use in a hanging basket or even spilling from a regular planter. 
                            If your plant becomes leggy over time, prune it back by pinching off the stems directly above a leaf node.

                            <b>Water:</b> Deeply water every 1 to 2 weeks, or whenever the soil feels dry. Drooping leaves often mean your plant needs a drink. <br>
                            Reduce water in the winter when plant growth slows. <br>
                            <b>Fertilize:</b> Not necessary, but an occasional dose of all-purpose houseplant food during the spring and summer will encourage more vigorous growth. <br>

                            Also known as Swiss cheese plant or split-leaf philodendron, this tropical beauty sports lush green leaves that develop deep slits or holes as they mature. 
                            In nature, these vine-like plants love to climb trees with their aerial roots, so provide a moss pole or other support to accommodate their ascent.

                            <b>Water:</b> Water moderately, allowing the soil to become dry to the touch before rewatering. Overwatering can cause root rot. <br>
                            <b>Fertilize:</b> Apply a balanced 20-20-20 liquid fertilizer monthly during the growing season, from mid-March to November. Cease fertilizing in winter when plant growth slows down. <br>

                            Peperomia is a bushy type native to the Brazilian forest, with fleshy variegated leaves. 
                            The thick leaves allow it to sustain itself in moderatly dry soil. 
                            It has unusual, long, slender, white flower spikes that are typical and grow no taller than one foot high.

                            A charming little foliage plant with cheery pink speckles over deep-green leaves. 
                            In addition to pink, cultivars sporting white or red dots are also available. 
                            Pinch back the stems of too tall or leggy plants to encourage bushier growth.
